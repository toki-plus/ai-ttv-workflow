## ‚ú® Core Features

This is more than just a video editor; it's a complete, intelligent workflow:

-   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Content Engine**:
    -   **One-Click Script Extraction**: Simply paste a Douyin (China's TikTok) share link to automatically extract the full video script.
    -   **AI-Powered Rewrite**: Perform deep paraphrasing and rewriting on existing text to generate unique, original content with a single click.
    -   **AI-Powered Translation**: Translate scripts into dozens of languages to effortlessly globalize your content.
    -   **Intelligent Title Generation**: Automatically creates catchy main titles and subtitles for your video cover based on the script's content.

-   **üéôÔ∏è Advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
    -   **High-Quality Voices**: Integrates with the Microsoft Edge TTS (`edge-tts`) engine, offering natural and fluent voices across multiple languages and genders.
    -   **Fine-Tuned Control**: Allows for precise adjustments of speech rate, pitch, and volume to match the emotional tone of your video.
    -   **Automatic Subtitle Generation**: Perfectly synchronized `.srt` subtitle files are generated alongside the audio.

-   **üé¨ Automated Video & Cover Synthesis**:
    -   **Powered by FFmpeg**: Utilizes the robust and efficient FFmpeg library for all video processing tasks.
    -   **Dynamic Subtitle Embedding**: Automatically burns subtitles into the video with support for custom fonts.
    -   **Personalized Branding**: Easily add a custom circular avatar, author name, and background music (BGM).
    -   **Professional Cover Art**: Automatically generates a 9:16 vertical cover image suitable for short-form video platforms.
    -   **üöÄ GPU Acceleration**: Supports NVIDIA (NVENC) hardware acceleration to dramatically reduce video rendering times.

-   **GUI & User Experience**:
    -   **Cross-Platform Interface**: Built with PyQt5, offering a clean and intuitive user experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    -   **Automatic Driver Management**: On the first use of AI features, the application automatically downloads the correct `chromedriver` to match your version of Chrome, eliminating manual setup.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### System Requirements

1.  **Python**: Version 3.8 or newer.
2.  **FFmpeg**: You **must** have FFmpeg installed and added to your system's PATH.
    -   Visit the [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for installation instructions.
    -   To check if it's installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and run `ffmpeg -version`. You should see version information printed.
3.  **Google Chrome**: Required for the AI-powered features.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/toki-plus/ai-ttv-workflow.git
    cd ai-ttv-workflow
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The first time you use an AI-related feature, the application will automatically download the matching `chromedriver` for you.

## üìñ Usage Guide

The application's top-to-bottom layout represents the recommended workflow.

1.  **Step 1: Get Your Script (Optional)**
    -   Before using AI features for the first time, click **"ÁôªÂΩïË±ÜÂåÖ" (Login Doubao)**. Log in within the browser window that appears (e.g., by scanning the QR code), and then **manually close the browser window**. Your session will be saved for future use.
    -   Paste a Douyin video link and click **"ÊèêÂèñÊñáÊ°à" (Extract Script)**. The script and recommended cover titles will be auto-filled.
    -   Alternatively, you can type or paste your own script directly into the text box.

2.  **Step 2: Edit and Refine Your Script**
    -   Manually edit the text as needed.
    -   Use the **"‰∏ÄÈîÆÂéüÂàõ" (Rewrite)** or **"‰∏ÄÈîÆÁøªËØë" (Translate)** buttons to have the AI process your script further.

3.  **Steps 3 & 4: Select a Voice and Adjust Parameters**
    -   Choose a language, gender, and specific voice from the dropdown menus.
    -   Use the sliders to fine-tune the speech rate, volume, and pitch.

4.  **Step 5: Generate Audio and Subtitles**
    -   Select an output directory for your files.
    -   Check the "Generate Subtitles" box (highly recommended).
    -   Click **"ÁîüÊàêÈü≥È¢ë" (Generate Audio)**. An `.mp3` audio file and an `.srt` subtitle file will be created.

5.  **Step 6: Configure and Generate the Video**
    -   The paths for the audio and subtitle files will be filled automatically.
    -   Configure your video's parameters: select an avatar image, a font file, set the author name, etc.
    -   (Optional) Add background music (BGM).
    -   If you have a supported NVIDIA GPU, check "Enable GPU Acceleration".
    -   Click **"ÁîüÊàêËßÜÈ¢ë" (Generate Video)**! After a short wait, your final `.mp4` video and cover image will be ready in your output directory.
